# Milestone 4: Communicating Results

## Overview

This folder contains our comprehensive communication strategy for translating
  research findings on student engagement patterns into actionable
    insights for educational stakeholders.

## Key Research Finding

**Student engagement metrics show a 91.4% correlation with academic performance,
  enabling early identification of at-risk students through behavioral data analysis.**
    This finding provides educational institutions with a clear intervention
      target for improving student outcomes.

## Communication Artifacts

### ðŸ“Š Interactive Dashboard

**Live Deployments:**

- **Primary Dashboard:** [https://fixed-dashboard.streamlit.app](https://fixed-dashboard.streamlit.app)
- **Enhanced UI Version:** [https://depth-dashboard.streamlit.app](https://depth-dashboard.streamlit.app)
- **Aurora Theme:** [https://aurora-dashboard.streamlit.app](https://aurora-dashboard.streamlit.app)

**Note:** All three versions offer the same core functionality with different
  UI/UX themes and minor feature variations.

## Primary Communication Artifact

## Research Foundation

Our communication strategy is built on robust technical analysis:

**Dataset:** 16,909 students across 50+ engineered features  
**Analysis:** Comprehensive EDA and machine learning with data leakage prevention
**Key Finding:** 91.4% correlation between engagement metrics and
  academic performance  
**Model Accuracy:** 92% with ultra-clean feature engineering

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Stakeholder Engagement

- Dashboard demonstrations
- One-on-one meetings with decision-makers
- Pilot program discussions

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation

- Selected institutional deployments
- Intervention protocol testing
- Performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Scale and Optimize

- Broader implementation
- Best practice documentation
- Continuous improvement

## Target Outcomes

**Short-term (3 months):**

- Dashboard adoption by educational institutions
- Pilot program implementation
- Stakeholder engagement and feedback

**Medium-term (6 months):**

- Measurable improvement in student engagement metrics
- Policy changes based on findings
- Additional research collaborations

**Long-term (12 months):**

- Scaled implementation across institutions
- Published best practices
- Sustainable analytics programs

## Communication Channels

### Primary: Interactive Dashboard

- Real-time data exploration
- Hands-on insight validation
