# Milestone 3: Structured Approach to Data Exploration and Analysis

This document outlines a structured approach for your team to effectively conduct
data exploration and analysis for Milestone 3. Building upon the cleaned data from
Milestone 2 and the key concepts from the "Learning from Data" workshop, this phase
aims to extract meaningful insights and build preliminary models to address your
Milestone 3 is about transforming your cleaned data into actionable knowledge. It
involves a cyclical process of exploring, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting
your data to uncover patterns, test hypotheses, and build initial predictive or
descriptive models. The emphasis is on critical thinking and understanding the

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
  containing your code, visualizations, and narrative explanations of your data
  exploration process.
- **Key Findings Summary:** A Markdown document (`.md`) summarizing the most
  significant insights gained from your EDA.
- **Preliminary Modeling Approach:** A Markdown document (`.md`) outlining your
  initial modeling strategy, including chosen algorithms and justification.

  A document reflecting the progress and key outcomes of Milestone 3.

Before diving deep, load your `cleaned_sed_dataset.csv` into your analysis
environment (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook). Perform basic sanity checks to ensure the
data is loaded correctly and matches your expectations from the cleaning phase.

## Structured Steps for Data Exploration and Analysis

### Step 1: Initial Data Loading and Sanity Checks

Before diving deep, load your `cleaned_sed_dataset.csv` into your analysis
environment (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook). Perform basic sanity checks to ensure
the data is loaded correctly and matches your expectations from the cleaning phase.

- Load the `cleaned_sed_dataset.csv` using Pandas.
Understand the distribution and characteristics of individual variables. This helps
identify outliers, skewness, and potential issues.
- Display the first few rows (`df.head()`).

- Check data types and non-null values (`df.info()`).

- Get basic descriptive statistics (`df.describe()`).

  - Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion
    (standard deviation, variance, quartiles).

### Step 2: Univariate Analysis

Explore relationships between pairs of variables and among multiple variables. This
is crucial for understanding how different aspects of student engagement relate to
academic performance and course completion.

- **Categorical Variables:**
  - Count unique values (`value_counts()`).
  - Visualize distributions using bar plots.
  - Use box plots or violin plots to compare numerical distributions across
    different categories.
- **Numerical Variables:**
  - Visualize distributions using histograms and box plots.
  - Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion
  (standard deviation, variance, quartiles).
- **Feature Engineering (if necessary):** Create new features from existing ones
  that might better capture underlying patterns (e.g., daily activity counts,
  engagement ratios).

Based on your research question and initial observations, formulate hypotheses and
use statistical tests to validate them. This moves beyond mere observation to

- **Formulate Hypotheses:**
  For example

  - "Students with higher forum participation rates will have higher academic
    performance."
- **Choose Appropriate Statistical Tests:** (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square
  tests, regression analysis) based on the type of variables and hypotheses.
- **Interpret Results:** Understand p-values, confidence intervals, and effect
  sizes. Remember the distinction between confidence and correctness.
  - Calculate correlation matrices for numerical variables.
  - Visualize correlations using heatmaps.
Based on your exploration and hypotheses, develop initial models to address your
research question. This is not about building a perfect production model, but about
demonstrating the feasibility and gaining initial insights.
- **Relationship between Categorical and Numerical Variables:**
- **Select Features:** Choose relevant features identified during EDA and
  hypothesis testing.
- **Choose Model Type:** (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision
  trees, simple clustering) based on your research question and data
- **Train and Evaluate:** Split your data into training and testing sets. Train your
  model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy,
  precision, recall, F1-score for classification; R-squared, RMSE for regression).
- **Relationship between Categorical Variables:**
  - Use cross-tabulations and stacked bar plots.

Throughout the process, document your findings, decisions, and interpretations.
This is crucial for transparency and reproducibility.

- **Narrative in Notebooks:** Explain your code, visualizations, and the insights
  derived from each step within your Jupyter notebooks.
- **Key Findings Summary:** Consolidate the most important discoveries, patterns,
  and relationships in a separate Markdown document. Focus on what directly
- **Preliminary Modeling Approach Document:** Detail your chosen modeling approach,
  the rationale behind it, and the initial results.

Based on your research question and initial observations, formulate hypotheses
and use statistical tests to validate them. This moves beyond mere observation
to drawing statistically supported conclusions.
Continuously consider the ethical implications of your analysis and the limitations
of your data and methods.

- **Bias Detection:** Be aware of potential biases in your data or analysis that
  could lead to unfair or inaccurate conclusions.
- **Generalizability:** Understand that conclusions drawn from a specific dataset
  may not generalize to all online learning environments. Be explicit about the
- **Privacy:** Reiterate the importance of data privacy and ensure your analysis
  respects the anonymization efforts of the dataset providers.
- **Confidence vs. Truth:** Always frame your conclusions in terms of confidence
  and support from the data, rather than absolute truth.

- **Choose Appropriate Statistical Tests:** (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square
tests, regression analysis) based on the type of variables and hypotheses.

- **Interpret Results:** Understand p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes.
Remember the distinction between confidence and correctness.

### Step 5: Preliminary Modeling

Based on your exploration and hypotheses, develop initial models to address your
research question.
This is not about building a perfect production model, but about demonstrating
the feasibility and gaining initial insights.

- **Define Target Variable:** (e.g., academic performance, course completion).

- **Select Features:** Choose relevant features identified during
EDA and hypothesis testing.

- **Choose Model Type:** (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision
trees, simple clustering) based on your research question and data characteristics.

- **Train and Evaluate:** Split your data into training and testing sets.
Train your model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics
(e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification;
R-squared, RMSE for regression).

- **Iterate:** Refine your features or model choice based on initial results.

### Step 6: Interpretation and Documentation

Throughout the process, document your findings, decisions, and interpretations.
This is crucial for transparency and reproducibility.

- **Narrative in Notebooks:** Explain your code, visualizations,
and the insights derived from each step within your Jupyter notebooks.

- **Key Findings Summary:** Consolidate the most important discoveries, patterns,
and relationships in a separate Markdown document. Focus on what directly
addresses your research question.

- **Preliminary Modeling Approach Document:** Detail your chosen modeling approach,
the rationale behind it, and the initial results.

### Step 7: Ethical Considerations and Limitations

Continuously consider the ethical implications of your analysis and the limitations
of your data and methods.

- **Bias Detection:** Be aware of potential biases in your data or analysis that
could lead to unfair or inaccurate conclusions.

- **Generalizability:** Understand that conclusions drawn from a specific dataset
may not generalize to all online learning environments. Be explicit about the
scope of your findings.

- **Privacy:** Reiterate the importance of data privacy and ensure your analysis
respects the anonymization efforts of the dataset providers.

- **Confidence vs. Truth:** Always frame your conclusions in terms of confidence
and support from the data, rather than absolute truth.
