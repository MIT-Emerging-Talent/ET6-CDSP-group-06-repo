## 🎯 Key Research Findings

### 🏆 **Most Significant Educational Discoveries**

#### **1. Resource Engagement Drives Overall Activity**

**Critical Finding**
Strong correlation (0.91) between resource views and total platform activity

**Educational Implications:**

- **Primary Intervention Target**: Resource quality and accessibility improvements
- **Early Warning System**: Use resource viewing patterns as engagement indicators
- **Strategic Focus**: Content development drives broader platform engagement

#### **2. Course Load Success Pattern**

**Discovery**
Students taking more courses achieve higher median performance
(11 courses → 750+ marks vs. 1 course → ~400 marks)

**Educational Insights:**

- **Motivation Effect**: Higher-achieving students successfully manage heavier loads
- **Policy Implications**
Course load restrictions may be unnecessary for motivated students
- **Support Targeting**: Focus resources on students with lighter
loads who may be struggling

#### **3. Performance Distribution Analysis**

**Pattern**: Right-skewed distribution centered around 500 marks

**Strategic Applications:**

- **Benchmarking**: 500 marks represents realistic performance expectation
- **Intervention Zones**: Lower quartile students need focused support
- **Enrichment Programs**: Right tail students ready for advanced challenges

#### **4. Assessment System Validation**

**Finding**: Strong linear relationship between average and total marks

**Quality Assurance:**

- **Internal Consistency**: Grading system shows reliability across assessments
- **Predictive Utility**: Average marks reliably predict total academic success
- **Early Warning**: Declining averages indicate risk for total performance

### Primary Discoveries

1. **Strong correlation (0.91)** between resource views and total platform
   activity
2. **Linear relationship** between average marks and total marks validates
   assessment consistency
3. **Engagement metrics** are significant predictors of course completion
4. **Z-score analysis** identified students with exceptional performance
   patterns

### Predictive Model Performance

- **Random Forest Regressor**: Best performance for predicting total marks
- **Logistic Regression**: Effective for binary course completion prediction
- **Feature importance**: `average_marks`, `num_resource_views`, and
  `total_events` are top predictors
