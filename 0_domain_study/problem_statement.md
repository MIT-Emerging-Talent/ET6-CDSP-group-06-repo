# Addressing Student Engagement in Online Learning

## Problem Identification

In the era of increasingly prevalent online learning, maintaining student
engagement has become a significant challenge. Many students, particularly
in self-paced or asynchronous online courses, struggle with motivation,
timely completion of assignments, and active participation. This leads to
higher dropout rates and reduced learning outcomes.

From a personal perspective, many students report feeling isolated and
unfocused during remote learning. This disengagement often shows up as
procrastination, minimal interaction with course materials or peers, and
ultimately, failure to achieve educational goals.
