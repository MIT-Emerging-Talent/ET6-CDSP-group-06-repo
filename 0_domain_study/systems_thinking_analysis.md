# Summary of the Group's Understanding of the Problem Domain (Applying Systems Thinking)

Applying systems thinking to student engagement in online learning reveals a
complex interplay of factors, not merely individual student shortcomings. The
problem of disengagement is an emergent property of the online learning system,
influenced by multiple interconnected elements:

## Events

Observable instances of disengagement, such as:

- Missed deadlines.
- Low forum participation.
- Minimal login activity.
- Poor performance on assessments.

## Patterns/Trends

Over time, these events form patterns, such as:

- A consistent decline in activity after the initial weeks of a course.
- Higher disengagement in certain types of courses (e.g., self-paced vs. instructor-led).
- Specific demographic groups showing lower engagement.

## Underlying Structures

These patterns are driven by structural elements within the online learning ecosystem:

### Course Design

- Lack of interactive elements.
- Monotonous content delivery.
- Insufficient opportunities for peer collaboration.
- Overwhelming workload.

### Platform Limitations

- User interface complexities.
- Poor accessibility.
- Inadequate technical support that frustrates students.

### Instructor Pedagogy

- One-way information delivery.
- Infrequent feedback.
- Lack of personalized attention from instructors.

### Institutional Policies

- Enrollment caps.
- Grading policies.
- Support services that do not adequately address the unique needs of online learners.

### Socio-economic Factors

- Students balancing work, family, or other commitments.
- Access to reliable internet and suitable learning environments.
- Financial pressures.

## Mental Models

The prevailing beliefs and assumptions held by stakeholders:

### Students

- Beliefs about self-discipline.
- The value of online degrees.
- The perception that online learning is inherently easier or less demanding.

### Instructors

- Assumptions about student autonomy.
- The effectiveness of traditional teaching methods in an online setting.
- The challenges of monitoring engagement remotely.

### Administrators

- Focus on enrollment numbers over retention rates.
- Lack of investment in robust online learning support systems.

## Conclusion

Understanding these interconnected layers through systems thinking allows the
team to move beyond simply observing disengagement to identifying leverage
points for intervention. For instance, addressing a lack of interactive course
design (structure) might be more impactful than solely focusing on individual
student motivation (event/pattern).
