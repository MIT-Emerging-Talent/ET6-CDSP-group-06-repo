# 🤖 Milestone 3: Data Analysis & Preliminary Modeling

## 🎯 Overview

This folder contains the data analysis and preliminary modeling components of
**Milestone 3**. Building upon the exploratory data analysis from the
`3_data_exploration` folder, this phase focuses on developing and evaluating
predictive models to answer our research question about student engagement and
academic performance.

## 📁 Folder Contents

### 📓 Jupyter Notebooks

- **[`data_analysis.ipynb`](data_analysis.ipynb)**: Comprehensive machine
  learning analysis including regression and classification models

### 📚 Reference Materials

- **[`guide.md`](guide.md)**: General guidance for data analysis phase

## 🔬 Analysis Overview

### Primary Modeling Objectives

1. **Regression Analysis**: Predict continuous total marks based on engagement
   metrics
2. **Classification Analysis**: Predict binary course completion outcomes
3. **Feature Importance**: Identify most influential predictors
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare performance across different algorithms

### Machine Learning Pipeline

#### 1. **Data Preparation** 🛠️

- Feature selection from comprehensive dataset
- Missing value imputation (filled with 0 for non-engagement)
- Infinite value handling for robust model training
- Train-test split (80/20) with consistent random seed

#### 2. **Regression Models** 📈

**Models Implemented:**

- **Linear Regression**: Baseline linear relationship modeling
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Non-linear pattern capture with ensemble method
- **Ridge Regression**: L2 regularization for overfitting prevention
- **Lasso Regression**: L1 regularization with automatic feature selection

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Lower values indicate better accuracy
- **R² (R-squared)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model

#### 3. **Feature Engineering** 🏗️

**Key Features Used:**

- **Academic Metrics**: `average_marks`, `number_of_quizzes_completed`
- **Engagement Metrics**: `total_events`, `num_resource_views`,
  `num_days_active`
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Login timing patterns, forum participation
- **Standardized Features**: Z-score normalized variables for outlier detection

#### 4. **Model Performance Analysis** 📊

**Feature Importance Analysis:**

- Random Forest feature importance rankings
- Identification of top predictive variables
- Validation of engagement hypothesis

## 🎯 Key Results

### 🏆 **Most Significant Achievement: Professional ML Debugging**

**Critical Learning Discovery**: The analysis revealed the most
valuable skill in professional machine learning
**detecting and correcting data leakage**.

#### **Initial Suspicious Results** 🚨

- **Perfect Classification Accuracy**: 99.97% with AUC = 1.000
- **Near-Perfect Regression**: R² = 1.00 for Random Forest
- **Red Flag Recognition**: "Too good to be true" performance indicators

#### **Systematic Diagnosis Process** 🔍

1. **Correlation Analysis**: Identified problematic features (e.g., `zscore_course_completed`)
2. **Feature Investigation**: Found target variable leakage in derived metrics  
3. **Root Cause**: Features containing outcome information contaminated predictions
4. **Professional Response**: Rebuilt models with clean feature sets

#### **Clean Model Results** ✅

- **Realistic Performance**: 75-85% accuracy (educationally meaningful)
- **Legitimate Features**: Only pre-completion engagement metrics
- **Honest Evaluation**: Demonstrates real-world prediction challenges
- **Actionable Insights**: Results suitable for educational interventions

**🔑 Key Lesson**
Perfect ML results often indicate modeling errors, not exceptional performance.
Critical evaluation skills are more valuable than high accuracy scores.
