# ET6 Collaborative Data Science Project – Group 06

[![CI Status](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-06-repo/actions/workflows/ci-checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-06-repo/actions/workflows/ci-checks.yml)

Welcome to our MIT Emerging Talent Collaborative Data Science Project repository.

This project explores how data science, collaboration, and domain expertise
intersect to solve real-world problems. We are currently
in **Milestone 1: Problem Identification**, focused on making an initial domain study
and framing an actionable research question in our project domain,
and within our groups’ constraints.

## 👋 Meet the Team

We are **The Animus⚛️** from the 2025 MIT Emerging Talent program. Our team brings
together diverse perspectives, technical backgrounds, and cultural experiences.
Through this project, we hope to:

- Strengthen our collaboration skills in a distributed, cross-cultural environment
- Learn how to design and execute data-driven research as a team
- Explore real-world applications of data science and contribute meaningful
insights to a selected domain

Our domain of interest will be defined in Milestone 1.
