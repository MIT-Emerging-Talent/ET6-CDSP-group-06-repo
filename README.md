## üéØ Milestone 1: Problem Identification

### Problem Statement

In the era of increasingly prevalent online learning, maintaining student
engagement has become a significant challenge. Many students, particularly in
self-paced or asynchronous online courses, struggle with motivation, timely
completion of assignments, and active participation. This leads to higher
dropout rates and reduced learning outcomes. This problem is exacerbated by the
lack of immediate feedback and personalized interaction often present in
traditional classroom settings. From a personal perspective, many of us have
experienced the isolation and difficulty in staying focused when learning
remotely, especially when faced with distractions or a lack of direct
accountability.

### Group Understanding (Systems Thinking)

Applying systems thinking to student engagement in online learning reveals a
complex interplay of factors:

- **Events:** Missed deadlines, low forum participation, minimal login activity.
- **Patterns:** Decline in activity after initial weeks, higher disengagement in
  self-paced courses.
- **Structures:** Course design flaws, platform limitations, instructor pedagogy,
  socio-economic factors.
- **Mental Models:** Student beliefs about self-discipline, instructor
  assumptions about autonomy.

### Actionable Research Question

#### Research Question

How do specific student interaction patterns with online course materials and
discussion forums predict academic performance and course completion rates in
online learning environments, and what interventions can be designed to improve
these metrics?

This question is:

- **Specific:** Focuses on interaction patterns and measurable outcomes.
- **Achievable:** Uses accessible LMS data (logins, forum activity, grades).
- **Actionable:** Findings can inform interventions like automated nudges or
  course redesigns.

### Key Stakeholders  

- **Students**: Primary users; their engagement behaviors directly impact
  outcomes.
- **Instructors**: Design courses and interventions (e.g., forum prompts,
  feedback).
- **LMS Providers**: Can implement platform changes (e.g., gamification,
  analytics).
- **Institutions**: Set policies (e.g., enrollment caps, support services).
- **Policymakers**: Fund infrastructure (e.g., broadband access for
  underserved students).

## Milestone 2: Data Collection Overview

This folder contains the primary dataset selected for our project, "Addressing
Student Engagement in Online Learning Environments," as part of Milestone 2:
Data Collection. The chosen dataset is the **Student Engagement Dataset (SED)**,
combined from various files to provide both granular activity logs and student
performance metrics.

The SED dataset was chosen as our primary dataset due to its comprehensive
nature, offering both raw student interaction logs and corresponding grade
information. This allows us to fulfill the Milestone 2 requirements of
collecting, cleaning, documenting, and hosting a dataset by engaging in the full
data modeling process‚Äîfrom raw observations to structured features. It directly
supports our actionable research question by providing the necessary data on
student interaction patterns, academic performance, and course completion rates.

**Files Included in this Folder:**

- `SED_Student_log.csv`: Contains granular student activity logs (component, action,
  target, userid, courseid, timecreated).
- `Student_activity_summary.csv`: Provides aggregated activity metrics per student.
- `Student_grade_aggregated.csv`: Contains aggregated grade information per student.
- `Student_grade_detailed.csv`: Provides detailed grade information per student
  per course.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Notes

- The `SED_Student_log.csv` is a large file and will require significant processing
  to extract meaningful features for engagement. This will involve timestamp parsing,
    grouping by user and course, and counting specific actions.
- Missing values and data types will need careful handling during the cleaning process.
- The `userid` and `courseid` columns will be crucial for joining the log data
  with the grade and activity summary files.

### Next Steps for Data Preparation

1. **Feature Engineering from `SED_Student_log.csv`:**  
   Transform raw log data into features representing student interaction patterns
   (e.g., total logins, time spent, forum activity counts, resource access  
   frequency).

2. **Data Integration:**  
   Join the engineered features from `SED_Student_log.csv` with  
   `Student_activity_summary.csv`, `Student_grade_aggregated.csv`, and  
   `Student_grade_detailed.csv` using `userid` and `courseid`.

3. **Final Cleaning and Validation:**  
   Address any remaining missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the  
   combined dataset.

4. **Final Data Dictionary:**  
   Create a comprehensive data dictionary for the final, cleaned, and integrated
   dataset.

## Milestone 3: Data Exploration & Analysis Overview

In Milestone 3, we conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
implemented preliminary machine learning models to validate our research
hypothesis and extract actionable insights from the Student Engagement Dataset
(SED).

### Data Analysis Key Achievements

**Advanced Feature Engineering:**

- Transformed raw student log data into 7+ meaningful engagement metrics
- Created temporal patterns (`num_days_active`, `total_engagement_time_sec`)
- Developed behavioral indicators (`forum_post_ratio`, `num_resource_views`)
- Implemented z-score standardization for statistical outlier detection

**Statistical Analysis & Discovery:**

- **Primary Finding**: Strong correlation (0.91) between resource views and
  total platform activity, indicating resource interaction drives overall
  engagement
- **Validation**: Linear relationship between average and total marks confirms
  assessment system consistency
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identified distinct student engagement profiles
  through comprehensive distribution analysis

**Machine Learning Success:**

- **Regression Models**: Implemented Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest
  regressors for total marks prediction
- **Best Performance**: Random Forest achieved highest R¬≤ score for academic
  outcome prediction
- **Feature Importance**: Identified `average_marks`, `num_resource_views`, and
  `total_events` as top predictors
- **Critical Discovery**: Demonstrated professional ML debugging by detecting
  and correcting data leakage - achieving realistic 75-85% accuracy instead of
  suspicious 99%+ performance

**Research Question Validation:**
Successfully demonstrated that **student engagement metrics predict academic
performance and course completion rates**:

- Resource viewing patterns serve as primary engagement indicators
- Temporal activity consistency predicts course completion probability
- Forum participation correlates significantly with academic success

### Predictive Modeling Results

Our preliminary machine learning pipeline revealed:

| Model Type         | Performance        | Key Insight  |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Random Forest**  | Highest R¬≤         | Best for capturing non-linear  |
|                    |                    | engagement patterns     |
| **Linear Regression** | Strong baseline  | Validates linear  |
|                    |                    | relationship assumptions     |
| **Ridge & Lasso**  | Good regularization| Effective feature selection and |
|                    |                    | overfitting prevention          |

**Top Predictive Features:**

1. `average_marks` - Academic performance consistency
2. `num_resource_views` - Primary engagement driver
3. `total_events` - Overall platform activity level
4. `num_days_active` - Temporal engagement persistence

### Educational Intervention Implications

Our analysis provides evidence-based foundations for:

**Early Warning Systems:**
