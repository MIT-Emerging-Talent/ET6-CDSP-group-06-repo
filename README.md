## 🎯 Problem Identification

### Problem Statement

In the era of increasingly prevalent online learning, maintaining student
engagement has become a significant challenge. Many students, particularly in
self-paced or asynchronous online courses, struggle with motivation, timely
completion of assignments, and active participation. This leads to higher
dropout rates and reduced learning outcomes. This problem is exacerbated by the
lack of immediate feedback and personalized interaction often present in
traditional classroom settings. From a personal perspective, many of us have
experienced the isolation and difficulty in staying focused when learning
remotely, especially when faced with distractions or a lack of direct
accountability.

### Group Understanding (Systems Thinking)

Applying systems thinking to student engagement in online learning reveals a
complex interplay of factors across multiple system levels:

### Actionable Research Question

#### Research Question

How do specific student interaction patterns with online course materials and
discussion forums predict academic performance and course completion rates in
online learning environments, and what interventions can be designed to improve
these metrics?

This question is:

- **Specific:** Focuses on interaction patterns and measurable outcomes.
- **Achievable:** Uses accessible LMS data (logins, forum activity, grades).
- **Actionable:** Findings can inform interventions like automated nudges or
  course redesigns.

### Key Stakeholders  

- **Students**: Primary users; their engagement behaviors directly impact
  outcomes.
- **Instructors**: Design courses and interventions (e.g., forum prompts,
  feedback).
- **LMS Providers**: Can implement platform changes (e.g., gamification,
  analytics).
- **Institutions**: Set policies (e.g., enrollment caps, support services).
- **Policymakers**: Fund infrastructure (e.g., broadband access for
  underserved students).

## 📊 Data Collection Overview

Our research utilizes the **Student Engagement Dataset (SED)**, a comprehensive
collection combining granular activity logs with student performance metrics.
The SED dataset provides both raw student interaction logs and corresponding
grade information, supporting our research question through complete data
modeling from raw observations to structured features.

**Dataset Components:**

- `SED_Student_log.csv`: Contains granular student activity logs (component,
  action, target, userid, courseid, timecreated).
- `Student_activity_summary.csv`: Provides aggregated activity metrics per
  student.
- `Student_grade_aggregated.csv`: Contains aggregated grade information per
  student.
- `Student_grade_detailed.csv`: Provides detailed grade information per student
  per course.

**Data Documentation:** Complete data dictionaries and preprocessing notes are
available in [`1_datasets/README.md`](1_datasets/README.md).

- Created temporal patterns (`num_days_active`, `total_engagement_time_sec`)
- Developed behavioral indicators (`forum_post_ratio`, `num_resource_views`)
- Implemented z-score standardization for statistical outlier detection

**Statistical Analysis & Discovery:**

- **Primary Finding**: Strong correlation (0.91) between resource views and
  total platform activity, indicating resource interaction drives overall
  engagement
- **Validation**: Linear relationship between average and total marks confirms
  assessment system consistency
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identified distinct student engagement profiles
  through comprehensive distribution analysis

**Machine Learning Success:**

- **Regression Models**: Implemented Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest
  regressors for total marks prediction
- **Best Performance**: Random Forest achieved highest R² score for academic
  outcome prediction
- **Feature Importance**: Identified `average_marks`, `num_resource_views`, and
  `total_events` as top predictors
- **Critical Discovery**: Demonstrated professional ML debugging by detecting
  and correcting data leakage - achieving realistic 75-85% accuracy instead of
  suspicious 99%+ performance

**Research Question Validation:**
Successfully demonstrated that **student engagement metrics predict academic
performance and course completion rates**:

- Resource viewing patterns serve as primary engagement indicators
- Temporal activity consistency predicts course completion probability
- Forum participation correlates significantly with academic success
