# ET6 Collaborative Data Science Project – Group 06

[![CI Status](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-06-repo/actions/workflows/ci-checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-06-repo/actions/workflows/ci-checks.yml)

Welcome to our MIT Emerging Talent Collaborative Data Science Project repository.

This project explores how data science, collaboration, and domain expertise
intersect to solve real-world problems. We are currently
in **Milestone 1: Problem Identification**, focused on making an initial domain study
and framing an actionable research question in our project domain,
and within our groups’ constraints.

## 👋 Meet the Team

We are **The Animus⚛️** from the 2025 MIT Emerging Talent program. Our team brings
together diverse perspectives, technical backgrounds, and cultural experiences.
Through this project, we hope to:

- Strengthen our collaboration skills in a distributed, cross-cultural environment
- Learn how to design and execute data-driven research as a team
- Explore real-world applications of data science and contribute meaningful
insights to a selected domain

Our domain of interest will be defined in Milestone 1.

## 🎯 Milestone 1: Problem Identification

### Problem Statement

In the era of increasingly prevalent online learning, maintaining student
engagement has become a significant challenge. Many students, particularly in
self-paced or asynchronous online courses, struggle with motivation, timely
completion of assignments, and active participation. This leads to higher
dropout rates and reduced learning outcomes. This problem is exacerbated by the
lack of immediate feedback and personalized interaction often present in
traditional classroom settings. From a personal perspective, many of us have
experienced the isolation and difficulty in staying focused when learning
remotely, especially when faced with distractions or a lack of direct
accountability.

### Group Understanding (Systems Thinking)

Applying systems thinking to student engagement in online learning reveals a
complex interplay of factors:

- **Events:** Missed deadlines, low forum participation, minimal login activity.
- **Patterns:** Decline in activity after initial weeks, higher disengagement in
  self-paced courses.
- **Structures:** Course design flaws, platform limitations, instructor pedagogy,
  socio-economic factors.
- **Mental Models:** Student beliefs about self-discipline, instructor
  assumptions about autonomy.

### Actionable Research Question

#### Research Question

How do specific student interaction patterns with online course materials and
discussion forums predict academic performance and course completion rates in
online learning environments, and what interventions can be designed to improve
these metrics?

This question is:

- **Specific:** Focuses on interaction patterns and measurable outcomes.
- **Achievable:** Uses accessible LMS data (logins, forum activity, grades).
- **Actionable:** Findings can inform interventions like automated nudges or
  course redesigns.

### Key Stakeholders  

- **Students**: Primary users; their engagement behaviors directly impact
  outcomes.
- **Instructors**: Design courses and interventions (e.g., forum prompts,
  feedback).
- **LMS Providers**: Can implement platform changes (e.g., gamification,
  analytics).
- **Institutions**: Set policies (e.g., enrollment caps, support services).
- **Policymakers**: Fund infrastructure (e.g., broadband access for
  underserved students).
