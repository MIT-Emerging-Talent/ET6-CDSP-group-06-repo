## 📦 Repository Structure

## 🧪 How to Contribute

### ✅ 1. Fork & Clone

```

### 🛠 2. Make Changes

- Keep your changes focused and well-organized
- Document clearly (especially in Jupyter notebooks and Markdown)
- Follow naming conventions and CI formatting standards

### 🧼 3. Lint & Format

Our CI checks require:

- Markdown formatting
- Python formatting (`ruff format`)
- Python linting (`ruff` + `pylint`)
- Folder/file structure cleanliness (`ls-lint`)

Run these locally if possible, or allow CI to catch errors during PR.

### 📥 4. Open a Pull Request

- Open a Pull Request against `main`

  `docs: update collaboration plan`, `feat: add EDA script`, etc.

Please include in your PR description:

- A summary of the change
- Related issue number (e.g., `Closes #4`)
- A checklist if it’s a multi-part feature

---

### 🔁 5. Review & Feedback

- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one team member
- Resolve all comments and ensure CI checks pass before merging

## 🧭 Collaboration Norms
