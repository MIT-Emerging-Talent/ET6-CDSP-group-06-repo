This retrospective is meant for looking back at how Milestone 5:
Final Presentation Event went and learning what to do differently next time.

## Behaviors, not People

Focus on what your group can _do_ that will make the next sprint better. Keep your
retrospectives _positive_ and _general_. **_You should NEVER mention people by name!!!_**

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- The structured approach to presentation development, building from our comprehensive
  documentation and dashboard work, allowed us to create a compelling narrative
  that effectively communicated our complete data science journey.
- The focus on storytelling with data helped us translate technical findings
  (91% correlation, 85% prediction accuracy) into accessible insights that
  resonated with diverse audiences including technical and business stakeholders.
- The integration of live dashboard demonstrations provided concrete evidence
  of our solution's practical value, making abstract statistical findings
  tangible and actionable for educational institutions.
- The emphasis on impact metrics (15-25% improvement in completion rates)
  successfully connected our research to real-world educational outcomes
  and institutional value propositions.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Initial attempts to include extensive technical detail proved overwhelming
  for the 2.5-minute format, requiring significant content refinement to
  balance technical rigor with accessibility and time constraints.
- Coordinating live demonstration timing within the presentation flow required
  more practice than anticipated, as technical demos can be unpredictable
  during high-stakes presentations.
- Ensuring all team members were equally prepared for potential Q&A sessions
  proved challenging given the breadth of technical and domain expertise
  required to address diverse audience questions.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We found it necessary to develop multiple presentation versions (technical
  vs. executive summary) to accommodate different audience segments and
  potential time variations, which wasn't initially planned but proved essential.
- We incorporated more emphasis on the collaborative process and team learning
  journey, as audiences were particularly interested in the cross-cultural
  collaboration and skill development aspects of the project.
- We added specific ROI calculations and business case elements to strengthen
  the institutional adoption argument, moving beyond pure research findings
  to practical implementation considerations.

### Or remove extra steps?

- We decided to streamline complex methodology explanations in favor of
  clear outcome communication, focusing on what the findings mean rather
  than detailed technical implementation, to maximize impact within time constraints.
- We removed extensive background context about online learning challenges
  in favor of immediate problem statement and solution demonstration,
  to maintain audience engagement and maximize solution focus.

## The Four Points

### Stop Doing

- **Over-engineering presentation complexity:** Focus on clear, impactful
  messaging rather than trying to demonstrate every technical capability
  and analytical sophistication within limited presentation time.
- **Underestimating rehearsal time requirements:** Technical demonstrations
  and timing coordination require extensive practice to ensure smooth
  delivery under presentation pressure.
- **Assuming audience familiarity with domain context:** Even educated
  audiences benefit from clear problem framing and context setting
  before diving into solution details and technical achievements.

### Continue Doing

- **Narrative-driven presentation structure:** The story arc from problem
  identification through solution deployment effectively engaged audiences
  and made technical work accessible to diverse stakeholder groups.
- **Live demonstration integration:** Hands-on dashboard interaction provided
  compelling evidence of solution viability and allowed audiences to
  experience the practical value of our research findings directly.
- **Impact-focused messaging:** Emphasizing measurable outcomes (completion
  rate improvements, early intervention capabilities) successfully connected
  technical work to real-world educational value and institutional benefits.
- **Professional presentation standards:** High-quality visual design and
  polished delivery enhanced credibility and stakeholder confidence in
  our solution's readiness for institutional adoption.

### Start Doing

- **Multi-format presentation preparation:** Develop presentation materials
  that can be adapted for different time constraints and audience types,
  ensuring flexibility for various presentation opportunities and contexts.
- **Comprehensive Q&A preparation:** Anticipate diverse audience questions
  across technical, implementation, and business domains to ensure confident
  responses that reinforce solution credibility and team expertise.
- **Stakeholder follow-up planning:** Prepare materials and processes for
  post-presentation engagement with interested institutions or potential
  collaborators who want to explore implementation opportunities.

### Lessons Learned

- **Presentation is product validation:** The final presentation serves as
  the ultimate test of whether technical work translates into communicable
  value that stakeholders can understand, trust, and act upon.
- **Storytelling amplifies technical impact:** Even sophisticated analysis
  requires compelling narrative structure to achieve maximum stakeholder
  engagement and adoption likelihood in real-world contexts.
- **Live demonstrations build confidence:** Interactive elements allow
  audiences to validate findings themselves, creating stronger conviction
  in solution viability than static presentations alone.
- **Professional presentation multiplies opportunities:** High-quality
  presentation materials and delivery create lasting impressions that
  can lead to future collaboration, employment, and project opportunities.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Fahed

The final presentation milestone taught me that technical excellence means nothing
without effective communication. Distilling months of collaborative data science
work into 2.5 minutes forced me to identify what truly matters to stakeholders -
not the complexity of our methods, but the clarity of our impact.

The experience of presenting live dashboard demonstrations under time pressure
showed me the importance of preparation and backup planning. Technical demos
can fail, but the story and insights must remain compelling regardless of
technical difficulties. This taught me to always have multiple ways to
communicate the same key message.

Most importantly, I learned that presentations are not just about sharing
results - they're about inspiring action. Our 91% correlation finding only
matters if institutions feel confident enough to implement our recommendations.
The presentation taught me to think like a stakeholder and communicate in
terms of their priorities and constraints.

### Caesar

The final presentation experience highlighted the critical importance of
translating technical work into business language and stakeholder value
propositions. I learned that even the most sophisticated analysis has
limited impact without clear communication of practical implications.

The process taught me to think beyond technical accuracy toward stakeholder
adoption and implementation feasibility. Presenting to diverse audiences
required understanding different perspectives and tailoring technical
depth to audience expertise and decision-making authority.

Most valuable was learning that presentations are collaborative conversations,
not one-way information transfer. Engaging with audience questions and
feedback taught me to defend technical choices while remaining open to
stakeholder concerns and implementation constraints.

### Team Learning Outcomes

Through Milestone 5, we experienced the complete transformation from technical
analysis to stakeholder communication, learning that data science projects
are only successful when findings translate into actionable insights that
stakeholders can confidently implement.

The collaborative presentation development process taught us that effective
communication requires the same rigor and iteration as technical analysis.
Multiple rehearsals, content refinement, and audience consideration proved
as important as statistical validation and model accuracy.

Most significantly, we learned that presentations are not project endings
but potential beginnings. High-quality communication of technical work
creates opportunities for continued collaboration, institutional partnerships,
and professional development that extend far beyond academic requirements.

The experience prepared us for professional data science roles where
technical capability must be matched by communication excellence to
achieve real-world impact and stakeholder adoption.
