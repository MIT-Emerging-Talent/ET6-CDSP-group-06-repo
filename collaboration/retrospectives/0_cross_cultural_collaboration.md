# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Waiting until the last minute to merge code, this caused avoidable conflicts.

- Using group chats to track tasks instead of a shared task board (led to confusion).

## Continue Doing

- Writing post-commit messages to explain major changes in GitHub.

## Start Doing

- When a branch has been merged and no longer needed, we should to delete it
to make everything neat.

- Always update the project board, and review available pull requests.

## Lessons Learned

- Group success depends more on communication than technical skill alone.

- Developed better time management skills by respecting deadlines and the
schedules of team members.
