# Retrospective â€“ Milestone 0: Cross-Cultural Collaboration

## Stop Doing

- Waiting too long to schedule the first meeting because of time-zone
uncertainty.
- Assuming everyone had the same expectations for communication frequency
without confirming.

## Continue Doing

- Being patient and respectful about different schedules and commitments.
- Using GitHub and shared docs to keep everyone informed asynchronously.
- Practicing active listening in meetings.

## Start Doing

- Setting clear agendas before meetings to stay focused.
- Rotating meeting times to share the burden of time zone differences.
- Clarifying action items and next steps at the end of each call.

## Lessons Learned

- Good communication is more important than perfect English or technical
knowledge.
- Acknowledging cultural differences helps avoid misunderstandings.
- Asynchronous collaboration tools (GitHub Issues, Docs) are essential for
distributed work.
- Building trust early makes future collaboration easier.
