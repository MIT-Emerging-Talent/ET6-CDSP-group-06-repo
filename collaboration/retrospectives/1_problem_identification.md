# üåÄ Retrospective: Milestone 1 - Problem Identification

> *"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
> did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and
> abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."*  
> ‚Äî Norm Kerth

This retrospective captures our reflections on **Milestone 1: Problem
Identification**, highlighting what worked well, what didn‚Äôt, and how we can
improve moving forward. Our objective is to continuously refine our
collaborative process, learning from experience to enhance efficiency and
impact.

## Strategy vs. Board Reflection

* **What parts of our plan went as expected?**
  * Our **structured analysis** of the syllabus clarified
    Milestone 1 expectations.
  * Dividing **domain research tasks** among team members enabled broad and
    efficient coverage.
  * Collaborative **problem statement discussions** were focused and
    constructive, leading to a coherent direction.

* **What parts of our plan did not work out?**
  * We spent **too much time in broad brainstorming**, which delayed narrowing our
    focus.
  * **Time estimates** for domain research were optimistic, causing some
    last-minute rushes.

* **Did we need to add things that weren't in our strategy?**
  * An early **feasibility check** on our research question helped ensure it was
    practical and data-answerable within the project scope.

* **Or remove extra steps?**
  * We gradually **streamlined internal communication**, adopting more efficient
    tools and workflows for sharing progress and findings.

### The Four Points

#### Stop Doing

* **Unbounded brainstorming**: Introduce clearer time limits or criteria for early
  ideation to avoid scope drift.
* **Underestimating research depth**: Acknowledge the iterative nature of research
  and plan time accordingly.
* **Delaying feasibility checks**: Ensure potential research questions are grounded
  in data availability and practical constraints from the start.

#### Continue Doing

* **Targeted task assignment**: Delegating research subtopics ensured
  comprehensive domain understanding.
* **Regular communication**: Check-ins and open channels helped us resolve
  blockers early.
* **Leveraging diverse input**: Multidisciplinary perspectives refined our
  framing of the problem.
* **Proactive documentation**: Our living documentation (`README.md`, planning
  notes) was key for transparency and traceability.

#### Start Doing

* **Structured ideation frameworks**: Use tools like ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù or mind
  maps to balance creativity with focus.
* **Early scan for data sources**: Identify data availability during problem
  ideation to prioritize feasible directions.
* **Dedicated synthesis time**: Reserve sessions specifically for aligning
  individual insights into a shared understanding and deliverables.

#### Lessons Learned

* **Framing matters**: A well-scoped, answerable problem is the cornerstone of a
  successful data project.
* **Research is iterative**: Progress often requires looping back, adapting as new
  insights emerge.
* **Teamwork drives results**: Collaboration, trust, and shared ownership are
  essential‚Äîespecially in the ambiguous early stages.
* **Constraints empower clarity**: Project limitations can sharpen focus, guiding
  us toward achievable, high-impact outcomes.

By reflecting on our process with honesty and openness, we aim to enter
Milestone 2 more focused, aligned, and effective.
