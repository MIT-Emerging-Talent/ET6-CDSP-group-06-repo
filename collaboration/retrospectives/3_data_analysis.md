# Retrospective â€“ Milestone 3: Data Exploration and Analysis

## Stop Doing

- Trying to clean all the data at once without clear sub-tasks.
- Assuming everyone was clear on feature definitions without alignment meetings.

## Continue Doing

- Regular weekly check-ins to share progress and blockers.
- Documenting EDA and modeling steps in shared notebooks.
- Sharing code early for feedback and integration.

## Start Doing

- Defining clearer acceptance criteria for "done" on notebooks.
- Using GitHub Issues to track assigned tasks more formally.
- Reviewing merged notebooks for consistency in visualization style and narrative.

## Lessons Learned

- Collaboration improves analysis quality, but requires time for alignment.
- Even simple linear regression needs careful EDA and validation.
- Visualizations are essential for non-technical communication.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Successfully split EDA and modeling tasks among team members.
- Finished the baseline regression model with interpretable results.
- Completed required notebooks on time for review.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Cleaning steps weren't fully standardized early, leading to redundant work.
- Feature engineering definitions varied among members at first.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Extra check-in meetings to align on data cleaning.
- Created new plots for non-technical communication materials.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Caesar

I made some big changes on one commit, and it made some difficulties, so i
learned to make more commits along the way to avoid big conflicts.
