## 🧠 Notes from Brainstorming

- Building trust means showing follow-through, clarity, and empathy.
- Respect means listening, not interrupting, and acknowledging others' input.
- Disagreements should be addressed openly but kindly.
- Slack/Discord ... for informal chat, GitHub for structured tasks and updates.
- Use structured meeting agendas to stay efficient.
- Every team member should feel ownership of part of the project.
- If trust is damaged, acknowledge it and repair it openly.
