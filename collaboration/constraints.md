# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project. This document outlines both external
 constraints (factors beyond our control) and internal constraints
 (team-specific challenges, both involuntary and voluntary) to
 provide a clear framework for delivering a successful project.

## External

External constraints are limitations imposed by factors outside the team’s
 direct control.

- **Internet Connectivity**: Unreliable or slow internet access can disrupt
communication, research, and collaborative workflows, affecting project progress.

## Internal: Involuntary

Internal involuntary constraints arise from unavoidable limitations within
 the team or organization.

- **Varying Levels in Programming**: The team has varying levels of
- programming expertise. Prioritizing tasks that align with team
 members’ learning goals or strengths to foster growth while
 ensuring quality output.
- **Time Availability**: Team members may have limited hours
 to dedicate to the project due to fixed schedules, personal commitments,
 or overlapping responsibilities.

## Internal: Voluntary

Voluntary internal constraints are self-imposed limitations set by the team
 to guide the project and ensure quality, efficiency,
 and alignment with goals.

- **Repository Collaboration**: All members will contribute to a shared GitHub
repository, promoting teamwork and collective ownership of the project.
