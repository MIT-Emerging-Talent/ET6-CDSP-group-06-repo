# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project. This document outlines both external
 constraints (factors beyond our control) and internal constraints
 (team-specific challenges, both involuntary and voluntary) to
 provide a clear framework for delivering a successful project.

## External

External constraints are limitations imposed by factors outside the team’s
 direct control.
<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
- **Internet Connectivity**: Unreliable or slow internet access can disrupt
communication, research, and collaborative workflows, affecting project progress.

## Internal: Involuntary

Internal involuntary constraints arise from unavoidable limitations within
 the team or organization.
<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
- **Varying Levels in Programming**:
The team has varying levels of programming expertise. Prioritizing tasks that
 align with team members’ learning goals or strengths to foster growth while
 ensuring quality output.
- **Time Availability**: Team members may have limited hours
 to dedicate to the project due to fixed schedules, personal commitments,
 or overlapping responsibilities.

## Internal: Voluntary

Voluntary internal constraints are self-imposed limitations set by the team
 to guide the project and ensure quality, efficiency, and alignment with goals.
<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
- **Repository Collaboration**: All members will contribute to a shared GitHub
repository, promoting teamwork and collective ownership of the project.
