# 🧱 Constraints

Some boundaries around our project — these constraints helpus
stay realistic, focused, and creative.

---

## 🌍 External Constraints  

_Constraints outside of our control._

- We have a fixed timeline (project must be completed by August 25).
- Our project scope must remain within a data science context
(no full-stack apps or hardware prototypes).
- We may only use public or ethically sourced data.
- All deliverables must follow the MIT Emerging Talent milestone structure and deadlines.
- Group members are spread across different time zones and schedules.

## ⛓️ Internal Constraints – Involuntary  

_Constraints we didn’t choose, but still need to work with._

- Team members have different levels of technical experience with data analysis
and Git.
- Internet stability and device access may vary for team members.
- Limited access to proprietary datasets or paid tools/services.
- English is not the first language for some members, which may
affect communication pace or clarity.

## 🎯 Internal Constraints – Voluntary  

_Constraints we are choosing to adopt to help us focus and grow._

- We will not aim to build a full product; instead, we’ll focus on strong research,
analysis, and communication artifacts.
- We will set a soft deadline of 48 hours before each milestone
to allow for reviews and backups.
- We will only include tools and code we understand and can explain clearly.
- We will prioritize clarity over complexity in both data and code.

📨 Communication

- Communication will primarily be asynchronous via Slack and GitHub,
with task tracking managed using GitHub issues and project boards.💬

🕒 Scheduling and Deadlines

Each team member should allocate specific working hours within their schedule
to ensure milestones are delivered on time while maintaining productivity and well-being.⏱️
