# 📚 Project Notes & Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation hub for our **Student Engagement in
Online Learning Environments** project! This repository contains detailed notes,
milestone documentation, and resources that chronicle our data science journey.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Our project focuses on understanding and improving student engagement in online
learning environments through data-driven insights and predictive modeling.

> **Research Question:** How do specific student interaction patterns with online
> course materials and discussion forums predict academic performance and course
> completion rates in online learning environments, and what interventions can be
> designed to improve these metrics?
