# Milestone 3: Key Concepts from "Learning from Data" Workshop

This document summarizes the core concepts discussed in the "Learning from Data"
workshop on July 1st, 2025, which are crucial for successfully navigating
Milestone 3: Data Exploration and Analysis.

## 1. Data Analysis in the Big Picture of Data Science

Data analysis is a critical component of data science research, but it's important
to understand its place within the broader context. While algorithms, machine
learning, and AI often capture significant attention, they represent only a small
part of data analysis. Milestone 3 focuses on the overarching goal of
**learning from data**, rather than merely running algorithms through libraries.

- **Milestone 0 (Cross-Cultural Collaboration):** Getting to know each other and
  setting norms.
- **Milestone 1 (Problem Identification):** Focused on the whole circle – the
  context of the research, asking: What is being studied? Who is studying it? Why
  are they studying it? And what will you do about it?
- **Milestone 2 (Data Collection):** Focused on the 'right leg of the triangle' –
  looking at the world, deciding what can be measured that aligns with the
  research question, and abstracting/simplifying the world for data science
  techniques.
- **Milestone 3 (Learning from Data):** The current milestone, focusing on how to
  learn something new about the world from the collected data. This is about
  building knowledge, not just running algorithms.
- **Next Milestone:** Will focus on the 'left leg of the triangle' – how to use
  new knowledge to act on and change the world.

## 2. Confidence vs. Correctness in Research Conclusions

A crucial distinction in data science research is between a conclusion being
**correct** (true or false about the world) and being **supported** by the data.
While a statement might be true about the world, it might not be supported by the
available data, especially if the data is difficult to access, private, or
distributed (e.g., financial data, blockchain data).

Data science allows us to have a **level of confidence** in what we learn, rather
than definitively stating something is true or false. The goal is to make
statements that are as confident and as supported as possible, even if they are
'weaker' or less broad. It is preferable to make weaker statements that are
well-supported by the data than strong statements that are unsupported.

Mathematical measures like **confidence intervals** are the technical way to show
this confidence. The challenge in later milestones will be to communicate this
confidence to a non-technical audience.

## 3. The Role of Algorithms and Critical Thinking

Within data analysis, algorithms are only a small part. The true basis for a
successful analysis is **critical thinking** – being very critical of the data
itself, the analysis techniques used, and what can legitimately be concluded from
the research. This critical approach happens at many different levels and angles.

It is essential to avoid the pitfall of tweaking things to achieve a desired
result. Instead, focus on the confidence level of your findings based on the data
and the analysis performed.

## Key Takeaways for Milestone 3

- **Focus on Learning:** Milestone 3 is about genuinely learning from your data,
  not just applying algorithms.
- **Confidence over Truth:** Understand that data science provides confidence in
  conclusions, not absolute truth. Your goal is to provide well-supported
  conclusions.
- **Criticality is Key:** Be highly critical of your data, your methods, and your
  conclusions. This is the foundation of robust analysis.

This document serves as a foundational understanding for your team as you embark
on the data exploration and analysis phase. It emphasizes the philosophical and
methodological underpinnings that will guide your practical work in Milestone 3.
