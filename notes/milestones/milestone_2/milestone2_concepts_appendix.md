# Appendix: Key Concepts from "Modeling the World Through Data" Workshop (June 17)

This appendix provides explanations of key concepts and terms directly discussed
in the "Modeling the World Through Data" workshop on June 17th. These concepts are
fundamental for your team to understand as you approach Milestone 2: Data Collection.

## 1. Data Modeling: Simplifying the World with Data

The central theme of the workshop was **data modeling**, which refers to the
process of representing aspects of the complex real world using data. The
instructor emphasized that the world is inherently complicated, and to
understand it, we must simplify it. This simplification involves:

* **Simplification:** Intentionally reducing the complexity of the real world by
  focusing on only the most relevant features for your research question.
* **Abstraction:** Converting complex real-world qualities into measurable,
  representable forms, often as numbers or categories. For example, a
  person's height can be abstracted to a number, or their arm position to a
  string like "Ru" (right arm up).
* **Losing Detail:** Acknowledging that any simplification or abstraction
  inevitably leads to a loss of some real-world detail. The data model is a
  simplified representation, not a perfect replica. For example, screen time
  data tells you an app was open, but not if the user was actively looking at it
  or engaged.

A significant portion of the workshop was dedicated to the critical evaluation of
data. The instructor stressed that "big data does not mean good data" or "the
right data". This is particularly pertinent for your project, which is
**question-first**, not data-first. Your data must support your research
question, not the other way around.

Two key directions for critiquing data were highlighted:

* **Critiquing the Measurement Process (World to Data):** This involves
  questioning what is being measured, its relevance and usefulness for your
  question, and ethical considerations (e.g., "Should we be measuring this? How
  do we measure this respectfully?").
* **Critiquing the Data Itself (Data to World):** This involves asking whether
  the dataset actually measures what it claims to measure and understanding its
  limitations (e.g., screen time data models "time app is open," not "active
  user attention"). It also involves considering uncertainty and missing
  values (e.g., empty squares in a dataset where information is unclear).

The workshop clarified that data, in its raw form, is merely **observations** or
**measurements of the world** It is not knowledge. The process of
transforming these observations into knowledge happens in later milestones (Data
Analysis). For Milestone 2, the focus is on understanding *what was observed*,
*how it was observed*, and *whether they are good observations*.

### 4. Different Formats and Types of Data

The workshop briefly touched upon different formats and types of data that you might
encounter, emphasizing that the format can influence what types of algorithmic analysis
are possible. This implies considering the structure and nature of the data you
collect.
