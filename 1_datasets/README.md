# ðŸ“¦ 1_datasets: Data Collection and Selection

This folder houses the raw datasets identified and selected for our project,
"Addressing Student Engagement in Online Learning Environments," as part of
Milestone 2: Data Collection. It also contains documentation detailing our data
selection process.

## Raw Datasets

The following raw datasets have been collected and are stored in the
`raw_data/` subfolder:

* `SED_Student_log.csv`: Granular log data of student activities.
* `Student_activity_summary.csv`: Aggregated activity metrics per student.
* `Student_grade_aggregated.csv`: Aggregated grade information per student.
* `Student_grade_detailed.csv`: Detailed grade information per student per course.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Notes

* The `SED_Student_log.csv` is a large file and will require significant processing
  to extract meaningful features for engagement. This will involve timestamp parsing,
    grouping by user and course, and counting specific actions.
* Missing values and data types will need careful handling during the cleaning process.
* The `userid` and `courseid` columns will be crucial for joining the log data
  with the grade and activity summary files.

### Data Selection Process

Our team evaluated several publicly available datasets to identify the most
suitable one for our actionable research question. The detailed evaluation
criteria and the justification for our final selection can be found in the
following document:

* [`milestone2_data_selection_justification.md`](milestone2_data_selection_justification.md):
  This document outlines the evaluation process and provides the rationale for
  choosing the Student Engagement Dataset (SED) as our primary dataset.

  further instructions and context for working with datasets in this phase.
